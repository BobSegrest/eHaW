Install improved wireless network driver
	Evolve III Maestro Update - Persistent WiFi Drivers For Linux! - YouTube
	
Install 73Linux with all options selected
	km4ack/73Linux (github.com)
	Installing all options (the logging application in particular) will meet the eHaW SQL server requirement

Open the Advanced Networking tool (not, the network tool) and…
	Click the Plus button to create a new connection
	Select Wi-Fi
	Set the Connection name to eHaW
	On the Wi-Fi tab
		Set the SID to ehaw (yes, lower case)
		Select Hospot as the Mode
	On the Wi-Fi Security tab
		Set the Security option to WPA &WPA2 Personal
		Set the Password to ehaw1234
		(yes, I know this is pretty light weight security, and it is intentional.  Remember that eHaW is by design OPEN to the Public.  We can't just set the security to None, because most Wi-Fi devices [phones, iPads…] will not connect to an entirely open network anymore)
	On the IPv4 Settings tab
		Verify the Method is set to Shared to other computers
		Click Add and enter the following information on the new Address line
			192.168.223.1	24	192.168.223.1
				The first address is where your hotspot network will start.  The 3rd quartet (223 in my example) needs to be unique within your Wi-Fi operating range. Any number between 1 and 255 will work, but most off the shelf devices (wireless routers…) tend to use 1 or a single digit, so I avoid them.  This address is also going to be the IP address for your system on the Hotspot network.
				The second number should almost always be 24, which limits the number of concurrent devices on your hotspot to a bit over 250.
				The 3rd address is the default route for your Hotspot network.  We set it to match your system because this is where we want the "Public" to connect.  And the plan to off eHaW (and nothing but eHaW) as the only service on this network.  Do NOT make any other change that would allow the Public to connect to any other network through your system.
		Check the box for Require IPv4 addressing
	Click Save then Close the Advanced Networking dialog
