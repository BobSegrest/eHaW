## The eHaW Node web service isn't a stand alone application...

eHaW Node is the public web application for the Emergency Health & Welfare Message service (eHaW).  It requires an application specific database, on a database server and a configured set of database access credentials to work.  These resources and their configuration are normally created as part of a well defined eHaW deployment process.
